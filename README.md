## Overview

The Movie Recommendation App is a Windows Forms application built using C# that provides users with a daily movie recommendation based on the current day and month's genre. The application leverages the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie data, including titles, overviews, ratings, and posters.

## Features

- **Dynamic Movie Recommendation:** The app dynamically fetches the top-rated movie for the current day based on the genre associated with the current month.

- **Genre Selection:** Each month is associated with a specific genre, ensuring that the recommended movie aligns with the month's theme.

- **User Interface:** The app offers a user-friendly interface with a movie title, overview, rating, genre, and poster display.
