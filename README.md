## Overview

The Movie Recommendation App is a Windows Forms application built using C# that provides users with a daily movie recommendation based on the current day and month's genre. The application leverages the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie data, including titles, overviews, ratings, and posters.

## Features

- **Dynamic Movie Recommendation:** The app dynamically fetches the top-rated movie for the current day based on the genre associated with the current month.

- **Genre Selection:** Each month is associated with a specific genre, ensuring that the recommended movie aligns with the month's theme.

- **User Interface:** The app offers a user-friendly interface with a movie title, overview, rating, genre, and poster display.

- **Error Handling:** The app handles cases where no popular movies are found for the day or if there's an error fetching data from the API.

## Usage
Upon running the application, it will automatically fetch and display the movie recommendation for the current day. The movie's title, overview, genre, and average rating will be displayed on the interface. If there are no popular movies for the day or if there's an error fetching data, appropriate messages will be shown.
