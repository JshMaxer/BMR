## Functional Requirements:

### Genre-Based Recommendations:

- **Functional:** The app recommends movies based on the genre of the current month.
- **Example:** For October, the app recommends Sci-Fi movies; for November, it recommends Horror movies, and so on.

### Display Movie Details:

- **Functional:** Users can view detailed information about a recommended movie.
- **Example:** Users can see the movie's title, overview, poster, and rating when they click on a movie recommendation.

### Refresh Recommendations:

- **Functional:** Users can manually refresh or change the recommended movie.
- **Example:** There is a "Next" or "Refresh" button that, when clicked, fetches and displays a new movie based on the current month's genre.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

### Performance:

- **Non-Functional:** The app should respond within 2 seconds when a user clicks to view movie details.
- **Example:** When a user clicks on a movie, the app should load and display the movie details without significant delay.

### Usability:

- **Non-Functional:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Example:** Users should be able to understand how to refresh recommendations without any guidance.

### Reliability:

- **Non-Functional:** The app should be available 24/7 with a maximum downtime of 1 hour per month for maintenance.
- **Example:** The app should be operational and accessible to users at all times, with scheduled maintenance communicated in advance.

### Security:

- **Non-Functional:** Data transmission between the app and server should be encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Example:** Movie data fetched from the server should be transmitted securely to the app using HTTPS to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

### Scalability:

- **Non-Functional:** The app should handle a minimum of 10,000 users concurrently without performance degradation.
- **Example:** The server architecture should be scalable, allowing for increased user load without compromising app performance.
